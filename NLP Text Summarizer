The code is a text summarization tool built using Python and the NLTK library. It takes a text input, processes it using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, and generates a concise summary. The summary is created by selecting the most important sentences based on word frequency and a user-defined percentage. Additionally, the code provides functionality to save the summary in both DOCX and PDF formats.

Main Functions:

generar_resumen(texto, porcentaje=20): This function is the core of the summarization process. It takes the input text and the desired percentage of sentences to include in the summary. It then tokenizes the text, removes stop words, calculates word frequencies, scores sentences based on word importance, and selects the top-ranked sentences to form the summary.

procesar_texto(b): This function handles the interaction with the user interface. It retrieves the text input and percentage value from the widgets, calls the generar_resumen function to create the summary, and updates the output widget with the result.

guardar_docx(b): This function saves the generated summary as a DOCX file. It creates a new Word document, adds the summary text, and downloads the file to the user's Colab environment.

guardar_pdf(b): This function saves the generated summary as a PDF file. It utilizes the ReportLab library to create a PDF document, formats the summary text, and downloads the file.

Additional Functions:

dividir_texto(texto, max_ancho, fuente, tamano, canvas): This function is used by guardar_pdf to properly format the summary text within the PDF document by dividing it into lines that fit within the page width.
